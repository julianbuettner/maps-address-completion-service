# Address completion service

Useful, when a user starts entering his address in a form,
and you want to provide auto completion for valid zip codes,
street names and house numbers.

The data has to be provided via `*.osm.pbf` OpenStreetMap files.
You can download them from [geofabrik.de](https://download.geofabrik.de/).
You can download multiple maps and can so provide completion for a
single part of a country up to the entire world.
